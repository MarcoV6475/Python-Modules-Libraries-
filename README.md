# Python-Modules-Libraries-
This is Module 6 Python Lab activity, we had a total of 6 different problems to solve. During each problem we were able to use the python documents which listed many functions from the random and math module. 
During each problems there were functions that we can use from the random and math modules, my responsiblity was to search the web to find other methods to get the same results used by the random and math modules. 
Problem 1 was to print 10 random numbers between 25-35.
Problem 2 was about priting an odd number between 0-100.
Problem 3 was about picking a random day of the week. 
Problem 4 was about finding a program that computes the approximination of pi like the math module. 
Problem 5 was about finding a program that converts radians to degrees like the math module.
Problem 6 was about using a for statement and finding a program that calculates the factorial function of a number the user inputs. 
Overall, these assignments help me understand the random and math modules better; and gain a real understanding of how python operates.
